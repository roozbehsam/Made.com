## Enabling DDD, TDD, Event-Driven Microservices 

This project is an example guide that introduces proven architectural design patterns to help developers manage application complexity.

**Patterns include:**
- Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)
- Domain-driven design's distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates
- Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage
- Events, commands, and the message bus
- Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)
- Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices

**Walk through:**
1. Domain Modeling
2. Repository Pattern
3. A Brief Interlude: On Coupling and Abstractions
4. Our First Use Case: API and Service Layer
5. TDD in High Gear and Low Gear
6. Unit of Work Pattern
7. Aggregates and Consistency Boundaries
8. Events and the Message Bus
9. Commands and Command Handler
10. Event-Driven Architecture: Using Events to Integrate Microservices
11. Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
12. Dependency Injection (and Bootstrapping)
